A new Python-Zabbix integration.

## Origins

[py-zabbix](https://github.com/adubkov/py-zabbix) got me far in life, but I wanted something a little different (and 
TLS for sending Zabbix Trappers). The goal is to have an well-featured Python Zabbix client, for both API and Trapper 
Metric interactions.
